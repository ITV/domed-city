  - Install it separately: https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault
  - New AWS config format: Uses `<product>-<ecosysyem>-[dev|pe|root]` profile names
  - If you want to use `itv-dev` role by default put `export ITV_DEV=true` into your shell's rc file
  - To skip invoking `aws-vault` run `export FREEZE_AWS_ENVVAR=true`
- To use Yubikey for MFA, set the following environment variable (with your email!):
  - `export YUBIKEY_MFA='Amazon Web Services:first.last@itv.com@itv-root'`
  - you must have ykman installed for this to work: https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/

# 7.1.0
FEATURES:
- Pin to Ruby 2.7.1
- Update vulnerable Rake

# 7.0.3
FEATURES:
- Allow dome to use `params/env.tf` from the environment level when running on new run-level `services`

# 7.0.2
FEATURES:
- Add `service` level where a business service can be defined within `<product>-infra/terraform/<product>-<ecosystem>/<environment>/<services>/<serviceX>`. This ensures a one services AWS S3 bucket with multiple uniquely named terraform state files.
- Add explicit validation for `services` and `roles` levels.

`NOTE: Do not use v7.0.0 or v7.0.1 as v7.0.2 contains the necessary incremental fixes.`

# 7.0.1
FEATURES:
- Provide better naming convention for service-level state file i.e. `<project>-<ecosystem>-<environment>-<services>.tfstate`.

# 7.0.0
FEATURES:
- Add `service` level where a business service can be defined within `<product>-infra/terraform/<product>-<ecosystem>/<environment>/<service>`. This ensures a service-specific AWS S3 bucket and terraform state file.

# 6.0.0

BREAKING CHANGE:

  - Terraform 0.10.x support

REQUIRED CHANGES:

  - Add a block for the s3 backend in the `main.tf` (example from root-infra):
    ```
    terraform {
      backend "s3" {
        bucket         = "root-tfstate-infraprd"
        key            = "infraprd-terraform.tfstate"
        region         = "eu-west-1"
        dynamodb_table = "root-tfstate-infraprd"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Pin the providers to specific versions: (example from root-infra):
    ```
    provider "aws" {
      region = "${var.region}"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }

    provider "template" {
      version = "1.0.0"
    }

    provider "terraform" {
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
    ```

# 5.0.0

Update hiera to 3.x, required for projects which implement Puppet 5.x

# 4.0.0

Breaking change:

Ecosystem variable within the ITV yaml now needs to be a hash - the Terraform run will fail hard if the ecosystems are not set to a hash within the config

# 3.1.0

Added hiera-eyaml support.

This allows us to use encrypted Terraform variables via hiera lookups (the `hiera.yaml` is consumed).

It also allows us to decrypt and extract SSL certificates or SSH keys which can then be used as appropriate.

In order to utilise these two improvements, you must update your `itv.yaml` e.g.:

```
dome:
  hiera_keys:
    artifactory_password: 'deirdre::artifactory_password'
  certs:
    sit.phoenix.itv.com.pem: 'phoenix::sit_wildcard_cert'
    phoenix.key: 'phoenix::certificate_key'
```

This release also containes:
- Improved debugging/output messages.
- More tests.

# 3.0.1

Forcibly unsetting environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`.
This is to prevent bypassing the user's local credentials specified in `~/.aws/credentials`.

Fixed bug where `dome --state` needed to be called first when setting up a new environment.
This requires some further testing but we may wish to remove this CLI option in the future.

# 3.0.0

Thanks to [@Russell-IO](https://github.com/Russell-IO) for helping with these changes.

- Internal refactoring.
- More tests added (but lots more needed).
- Improved debug output and explained up front how variables are set.
- Removed `aws_profile_parser` and used environment variables instead to unify
the AWS CLI and terraform calls.

ROADMAP:
- Merge [@mhlias](https://github.com/mhlias) changes that implements assumed-role support.
